# Sketches

This repository is a collection of programming ideas. It is not organized into a project and there is no way to build any of it; in fact none of this code has been tested. It is just a place to keep ideas I have had on implementation patterns or languages.

As such, the license is probably unnecessary, as anything here would require a lot of work to even...work. However, in the interests of disclosure and to protect myself, my work and any current or former employers I have decided to make it public and licensed.
